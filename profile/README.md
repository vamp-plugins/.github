Developer Resources for Vamp Plugins
====================================

[Vamp](https://vamp-plugins.org/) is an audio processing plugin system
for plugins that extract descriptive information from audio data â€”
typically referred to as _audio analysis plugins_ or _audio feature
extraction plugins_.

You will find developer resources and information about the plugin
format here. Please refer to the [website](https://vamp-plugins.org/)
for user documentation and details about available plugins and hosts.

### SDKs for Plugin and Host Development

Two C++ SDKs are available, producing generally compatible results but
with certain technical tradeoffs.

* [`vamp-plugin-sdk`](https://github.com/vamp-plugins/vamp-plugin-sdk)
  is the original C++ SDK for writing both plugins and hosts. It
  supports all Vamp features and is compatible with C++11 or newer
  standards.
  * Plugins built with this SDK can be used in all Vamp hosts,
    although some hosts can only handle limited subsets of feature
    types regardless of the SDK used.
  * Hosts built with this SDK can load all Vamp plugins.
  
* [`rt-vamp-plugin-sdk`](https://github.com/lukasberbuer/rt-vamp-plugin-sdk)
  is an alternative C++ SDK for use in real-time performance-critical
  applications, supporting a limited subset of output feature
  types and requiring C++20 or newer.
  * Plugins built with this SDK can be used in all Vamp hosts. They
    can only return [a limited subset](https://github.com/lukasberbuer/rt-vamp-plugin-sdk?tab=readme-ov-file#plugin-restrictions) of feature types, but if your
    plugin requires only those feature types and you are confident
    this won't change, there is no technical disadvantage to using
    this SDK.
  * Hosts built with this SDK can load all Vamp plugins that use the
    same limited subset of feature types. But only those plugins also
    built with this SDK will be real-time safe.

### Tools for Testing Plugins and Hosts

* [`vamp-plugin-tester`](https://github.com/vamp-plugins/vamp-plugin-tester)
  is a command-line testing host for Vamp plugins. It runs a considerable
  number of tests and reports any problems it finds. It should be used
  before making any public release of a plugin.
  
* [`vamp-test-plugin`](https://github.com/vamp-plugins/vamp-test-plugin)
  is a test plugin for use when writing Vamp hosts. Unlike the plugin
  tester, it can't run any tests itself but provides a variety of
  different output types which you can use to check the behaviour of
  your host.
